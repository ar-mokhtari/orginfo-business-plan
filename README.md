Executive Summary
Overview
The executive summary is the most important section of a business
plan – it must draw readers into your plan and entice them to continue
reading. If your executive summary doesn't capture readers' attention,
they won't read further. If you're seeking investment funds, an
uninspiring executive summary will turn potential investors off from
investing in your company and can be disastrous to the launch of your
venture.
After reading the executive summary, readers should have a basic
understanding of your business and, ideally, be excited about its
potential. At the very least, readers should be interested enough to read
further to learn more about your products and services, your marketing
plan, and your financial projections.
The key of this section is to be brief yet exciting.
The executive summary should include the following:
● Your objective
● The target market
● Your company's products and services
● The business's marketing plan
● A competitive analysis
● Funding and budget allocation for your company's processes and
operations
