and consistent from batch to batch and product to product (or job
to job). How will you measure quality?
Location
If you have or need physical locations, explain them in more detail
in this section. Include details such as the size of the locations, rent
costs, maintenance, utilities, insurance, and any remodeling
expenses. Explain the type of building and any zoning restrictions
or requirements.

are you prepared to handle legal requirements? What is the status
of those legal requirements? These are some common examples:
● Licenses and/or permits
● Trademarks, copyrights, etc.
● Insurance coverage your business requires (and how much)
● Environmental, health or workplace regulations
● Additional special regulations in your industry

Inventory
If your business operates with inventory, you will need to detail the
following:
● What type of inventory do you have (e.g., raw materials,
supplies, finished products)?
● What is your investment in this inventory? What is the value of
it?
● What is your projected inventory turnover rate?
● Do you have seasonal peaks for inventory? How will this affect
your annual business operations?
● What is your lead time for ordering inventory?
● Do you store your inventory somewhere? Explain where it's
located and how it's stored.

Payment Terms and Credit Lines
How will you accept payments from customers? Will you provide a
credit line? What will be your credit policy?
Management and Organization
Before anyone will invest in your business, they want a complete
understanding of whom they are investing in. This section should
illustrate how your business is organized. List key members of the
management team, the founders/owners, board members,
advisors, etc.
As you list each individual, provide a summary of their experience
and their role within your company. Treat this section as a series of
mini resumes, and consider appending full-length resumes or
curricula vitae to your business plan.
Resume Summaries
Include a brief description of the resumes of the owner(s) and key
managers or employees. These summaries should discuss the
experiences these individuals have that pertain to the business
and any history they have running or managing a business.
20

Management Gaps
If there are gaps in your management team, explain how you plan
to fill them. For instance, if you don't have marketing experience,
will you hire a chief marketing officer?
Advisors
List the members of your professional/advisory support team.
Include a brief biography of each member and an explanation of
how they will support the business.
Organizational Chart
Develop and include an organizational chart with your existing
team and any new roles you plan to fill.

and any capital that exists.
21
Business Name/Company Logo
Startup Expenses
List all of the business expenses you will incur and how you came
up with the amounts.
These are some common business startup costs:
● Research
● Insurance and licensing
● Technology and equipment
● Legal fees
● Marketing
[Read more on startup business costs.]
Develop Budgets
Once you have an idea of your total business expenses, you can
develop a budget. Keep in mind that new businesses often require
more capital than what owners initially expect. You should add a
contingency plan in case you need additional funds.
Plan for Capital
Do you have current investors? How much capital are they
investing? How do you plan to raise capital? If you plan to apply for
a business loan, you should provide information on the lender and
the amount you are trying to finance.
22
Business Name/Company Logo
Personal Financial Statement
If the goal of the business plan is to acquire financing, include
personal financial statements for each owner and any key
stockholder.
You should include details of each owner's assets and liabilities
outside of the business and their personal net worth in this section.
Financial Plan
Provide a detailed overview of your finances. Include any historical
data, if relevant; otherwise, you will need to develop and list
projections here.
Here are some examples of what to include in a financial plan:
● Cash flow projections or statements
● Profit and loss projection
● Balance sheets
● Sales plan
Make sure this section is precise and accurate. It's often best
practice to create this section with help from a professional
accountant.
23

Finally, if you're seeking outside funding for your business, highlight
why you're seeking financing, where that money will go, and when
investors can expect a return on their investment.
Cash Flow Projections or Statements
The cash flow statement tracks how much cash your business has
coming in and out of it at any given time. If you currently don't
have any cash flow statements to show, you need to provide a
cash flow projection. A cash flow projection helps you budget for
upcoming expenses so you don't run out of money.
Develop a cash flow projection for the following items:
● Inventory
● Rent
● Payroll
● Marketing expenses
● Customer payments
Profit and Loss Projection
A profit and loss (P&L) statement compares the total revenue for a
business against its debt and expenses. Essentially, all of the
company's expenses are subtracted from the income. Other
names for a P&L statement are "income statement," "earnings
statement," "revenue statement," "operating statement,"
24
Business Name/Company Logo
"statement of operations" and "statement of financial
performance.”
There are three parts of a P&L statement:
● First, subtract the cost of goods sold from revenue – this
represents gross profit.
● Next, deduct operating expenses from the gross profit,
leaving the operating profit. (These are earnings before
interest and taxes.)
● Then, subtract nonoperating revenues and expenses from the
total, leaving the total profit or loss.
If you are creating a P&L projection, explain how you determined
your numbers.
Projected Balance Sheet
A balance sheet offers a way to scrutinize your business and
outline its worth. A balance sheet is different from a measure of
profit and loss. It's a list of assets and liabilities. Any good balance
sheet includes these basics:
● What the business owns or expects to own (real estate,
vehicles, office equipment, etc.)
● Revenue you expect to take in (accounts receivable)
● Expenses you expect to pay out (accounts payable)

Sales Plan
Lastly, you need to create a sales forecast. This section details
projected total sales volume and where it will come from.
[Find out how to create a full sales plan in more detail.]

section of your business plan.
These are some items business owners include in their
appendices:
● Agreements
● Intellectual property (trademarks, licenses, patents, etc.)
● Resumes of owners and key employees
● Insurance policies
● Advertising/marketing materials
● Blueprints/plans
● List of equipment
